implement == to use equals
implement same? to use real ==

I think that during cell lookup there needs to be a check - isAppropriate? that allows the division between classes and objects to be respected in lookup.











How to refer to full class names?
   Foo
   java:util:HashMap
   xml:com:sun:blarg:Foo$Bar$Quux  ;; inner classes
   xml:com:sun:blarg:Foo Bar Quux  ;; inner classes

Importing:
  JavaGround#import

   import(java:util:HashMap)

 assignment works too:

   HMap = java:util:HashMap

The class referred is the real class.

Create new instances with new

   HMap new

To figure out:
 - how to call overloaded methods
 - args by name functionality?
 - how to send code to Java methods?
    maybe something like this:
      Thread new(Runnable: callSomeExpensiveThing)
      Thread new(run: callSomeExpensiveThing)
      Collections sort(list, fn(x, y, x <=> y))
      Collections sort(list, compareTo: (x, y, x <=> y))

 - how to see difference between fields and methods
 - how to implement interfaces
 - how to extend from Java classes in some way


 - add loads of good helpers to Java types




Code:
 all interfaces and classes are activatable, so you can create a new simple implementatino of Comparable by calling it:
   Comparable(x, y, y <=> x)

   Comparable(
     compareTo: fn(x,y, x<=>y),
     equals: fn(other, other == 1)
   )

 keyword arguments will use the paranamer approach
