            A character stream - an <see cref="T:Antlr.Runtime.ICharStream" /> - that loads
            and caches the contents of it's underlying file fully during
            object construction
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            This looks very much like an ANTLReaderStream or an ANTLRInputStream
            but, it is a special case. Since we know the exact size of the file to
            load, we can avoid lots of data copying and buffer resizing.

            <remarks>
            No buffering is required to do this unless you know your stream
            will use seek to move backwards such as when backtracking.
            This is different from rewind in its multi-directional requirement
            and in that its argument is strictly an input cursor (index).
            For char streams, seeking forward must update the stream state such
            as line number.  For seeking backwards, you will be presumably
            backtracking using the
            <see cref="M:Antlr.Runtime.IIntStream.Mark" />/<see cref="M:Antlr.Runtime.IIntStream.Rewind(System.Int32)" />
            mechanism that restores state and so this method does not need to
            update state when seeking backwards.
            Currently, this method is only used for efficient backtracking using
            memoization, but in the future it may be used for incremental parsing.
            The index is 0..n-1. A seek to position i means that LA(1) will return
            the ith symbol.  So, seeking to 0 means LA(1) will return the first
            element in the stream.

            <remarks>
            To avoid English-only error messages and to generally make things
            as flexible as possible, these exceptions are not created with strings,
            but rather the information necessary to generate an error.  Then
            the various reporting methods in Parser and Lexer can be overridden
            to generate a localized error message.  For example, MismatchedToken
            exceptions are built with the expected token type.
            So, don't expect getMessage() to return anything.
            You can access the stack trace, which means that you can compute the
            complete trace of rules from the start symbol. This gives you considerable
            context information with which to generate useful error messages.
            ANTLR generates code that throws exceptions upon recognition error and
            also generates code to catch these exceptions in each rule.  If you
            want to quit upon first error, you can turn off the automatic error
            handling mechanism using rulecatch action, but you still need to
            override methods mismatch and recoverFromMismatchSet.
            In general, the recognition exceptions can track where in a grammar a
            problem occurred and/or what was the expected input.  While the parser
            knows its state (such as current input symbol and line info) that
            state can change before the exception is reported so current token index
            is computed and stored at exception time.  From this info, you can
            perhaps print an entire line of input not just a single token, for example.
            Better to just say the recognizer had a problem and then let the parser
            figure out a fancy report.

            What does a tree look like?  ANTLR has a number of support classes
            such as CommonTreeNodeStream that work on these kinds of trees.  You
            don't have to make your trees implement this interface, but if you do,
            you'll be able to use more support code.
            NOTE: When constructing trees, ANTLR can build any kind of tree; it can
            even use Token objects as trees if you add a child list to your tokens.
            This is a tree node without any payload; just navigation and factory stuff.

            to build an event stack or something.
            Across a socket for remote debugging, only the RecognitionException
            data fields are transmitted.  The token object or whatever that
            caused the problem was the last object referenced by LT.  The
            immediately preceding LT event should hold the unexpected Token or
            char.
            Here is a sample event trace for grammar:
            b : C ({;}A|B) // {;} is there to prevent A|B becoming a set
            | D
            ;
            The sequence for this rule (with no viable alt in the subrule) for
            input 'c c' (there are 3 tokens) is:
            Commence

            <remarks>
            In order to create nodes and navigate, this class needs a TreeAdaptor.
            This class can build a token type -&gt; node index for repeated use or for
            iterating over the various nodes with a particular type.
            This class works in conjunction with the TreeAdaptor rather than moving
            all this functionality into the adaptor.  An adaptor helps build and
            navigate trees using methods.  This class helps you do it with string
            patterns like "(A B C)".  You can create a tree from that pattern or
            match subtrees against it.

            No new nodes should be created in tree during the walk.  A small buffer

            the lookahead mechanism is fairly complicated.

            That part is not yet implemented.  Will permit a rule to return

            we can Emit many tokens for every MoveNext() call, it's pretty hard to

            This routine does *not* cause the 'Current' property to ever return the

            The state of a lexer, parser, or tree parser are collected into
            external state objects so that the state can be shared. This sharing
            is needed to have one grammar import others and share same error
            variables and other state variables.  It's a kind of explicit multiple
            inheritance via delegation of methods and shared state.

            To get out of recovery mode, the parser must successfully Match
            a token (after a resync).  So it will go:
            1. error occurs
            2. enter recovery mode, report error
            3. consume until token found in resynch set

            What error message should be generated for the various exception types?
            Not very object-oriented code, but I like having all error message generation
            within one method rather than spread among all of the exception classes. This
            also makes it much easier for the exception handling because the exception
            classes do not have to have pointers back to this object to access utility
            routines and so on. Also, changing the message for an exception type would be
            difficult because you would have to subclassing exception, but then somehow get
            ANTLR to make those kinds of exception objects instead of the default.
            This looks weird, but trust me--it makes the most sense in terms of flexibility.
            For grammar debugging, you will want to override this to add more information
            such as the stack frame with GetRuleInvocationStack(e, this.GetType().Fullname)
            and, for no viable alts, the decision description and state etc...

            LA(1) is not what we are looking for.  If LA(2) has the right token,

            and LA(2) as if we were doing a normal Match(), which advances the
            input.
            MISSING TOKEN
            If current token is consistent with what could come after
            ttype then it is ok to "insert" the missing token, else throw
            exception For example, Input "i=(3;" is clearly missing the
            ')'.  When the parser returns from the nested call to expr, it
            will have call chain:
            stat -&gt; expr -&gt; atom
            and it will be trying to Match the ')' at this point in the
            derivation:
            =&gt; ID '=' '(' INT ')' ('+' atom)* ';'
            ^
            Match() will see that ';' doesn't Match ')' and report a
            mismatched token error.  To Recover, it sees that LA(1)==';'
            is in the set of tokens that can follow the ')' token

            This is set of token types that can follow a specific rule
            reference given a specific call chain.  You get the set of
            viable tokens that can possibly come next (lookahead depth 1)
            given the current call chain.  Contrast this with the
            definition of plain FOLLOW for rule r:
            FOLLOW(r)={x | S=&gt;*alpha r beta in G and x in FIRST(beta)}
            where x in T* and alpha, beta in V*; T is set of terminals and
            V is the set of terminals and nonterminals.  In other words,
            FOLLOW(r) is the set of all tokens that can possibly follow
            references to r in *any* sentential form (context).  At
            runtime, however, we know precisely which context applies as
            we have the call chain.  We may compute the exact (rather
            than covering superset) set of following tokens.
            For example, consider grammar:
            stat : ID '=' expr ';'      // FOLLOW(stat)=={EOF}
            | "return" expr '.'
            ;
            expr : atom ('+' atom)* ;   // FOLLOW(expr)=={';','.',')'}
            atom : INT                  // FOLLOW(atom)=={'+',')',';','.'}
            | '(' expr ')'
            ;
            The FOLLOW sets are all inclusive whereas context-sensitive
            FOLLOW sets are precisely what could follow a rule reference.
            For input input "i=(3);", here is the derivation:
            stat =&gt; ID '=' expr ';'
            =&gt; ID '=' atom ('+' atom)* ';'
            =&gt; ID '=' '(' expr ')' ('+' atom)* ';'
            =&gt; ID '=' '(' atom ')' ('+' atom)* ';'
            =&gt; ID '=' '(' INT ')' ('+' atom)* ';'
            =&gt; ID '=' '(' INT ')' ';'
            At the "3" token, you'd have a call chain of
            stat -&gt; expr -&gt; atom -&gt; expr -&gt; atom
            What can follow that specific nested ref to atom?  Exactly ')'
            as you can see by looking at the derivation of this specific
            input.  Contrast this with the FOLLOW(atom)={'+',')',';','.'}.
            You want the exact viable token set when recovering from a
            token mismatch.  Upon token mismatch, if LA(1) is member of
            the viable next token set, then you know there is most likely
            a missing token in the input stream.  "Insert" one by just not
            throwing an exception.

            <remarks>
            The recognizer attempts to recover from single missing
            symbols. But, actions might refer to that missing symbol.
            For example, x=ID {f($x);}. The action clearly assumes
            that there has been an identifier matched previously and that
            $x points at that token. If that token is missing, but
            the next token in the stream is what we want we assume that
            this token is missing and we keep going. Because we
            have to return some token to replace the missing token,
            we have to conjure one up. This method gives the user control
            over the tokens returned for missing tokens. Mostly,
            you will want to create something special for identifier
            tokens. For literals such as '{' and ',', the default
            action in the parser or tree parser works. It simply creates
            a CommonToken of the appropriate type. The text will be the token.
            If you change what tokens must be created by the lexer,
            override this method to create the appropriate tokens.

            <remarks>
            You can insert stuff, Replace, and delete chunks.  Note that the
            operations are done lazily--only if you convert the buffer to a
            String.  This is very efficient because you are not moving data around
            all the time.  As the buffer of tokens is converted to strings, the
            ToString() method(s) check to see if there is an operation at the
            current index.  If so, the operation is done and then normal String
            rendering continues on the buffer.  This is like having multiple Turing
            machine instruction streams (programs) operating on a single input tape. :)
            Since the operations are done lazily at ToString-time, operations do not
            screw up the token index values.  That is, an insert operation at token
            index i does not change the index values for tokens i+1..n-1.
            Because operations never actually alter the buffer, you may always get
            the original token stream back without undoing anything.  Since
            the instructions are queued up, you can easily simulate transactions and
            roll back any changes if there is an error just by removing instructions.
            For example,
            CharStream input = new ANTLRFileStream("input");
            TLexer lex = new TLexer(input);
            TokenRewriteStream tokens = new TokenRewriteStream(lex);
            T parser = new T(tokens);
            parser.startRule();
            Then in the rules, you can execute
            IToken t,u;
            ...
            input.InsertAfter(t, "text to put after t");}
            input.InsertAfter(u, "text after u");}
            System.out.println(tokens.ToString());
            Actually, you have to cast the 'input' to a TokenRewriteStream. :(
            You can also have multiple "instruction streams" and get multiple
            rewrites from a single pass over the input.  Just name the instruction
            streams and use that name again when printing the buffer.  This could be
            useful for generating a C file and also its header file--all from the
            same buffer:
            tokens.InsertAfter("pass1", t, "text to put after t");}
            tokens.InsertAfter("pass2", u, "text after u");}
            System.out.println(tokens.ToString("pass1"));
            System.out.println(tokens.ToString("pass2"));
            If you don't use named rewrite streams, a "default" stream is used as
            the first example shows.

            <remarks>We need to combine operations and report invalid operations (like
            overlapping replaces that are not completed nested).  Inserts to
            same index need to be combined etc...   Here are the cases:
            I.i.u I.j.v								leave alone, nonoverlapping
            I.i.u I.i.v								combine: Iivu
            R.i-j.u R.x-y.v	| i-j in x-y			delete first R
            R.i-j.u R.i-j.v							delete first R
            R.i-j.u R.x-y.v	| x-y in i-j			ERROR
            R.i-j.u R.x-y.v	| boundaries overlap	ERROR
            I.i.u R.x-y.v | i in x-y				delete I
            I.i.u R.x-y.v | i not in x-y			leave alone, nonoverlapping
            R.x-y.v I.i.u | i in x-y				ERROR
            R.x-y.v I.x.u 							R.x-y.uv (combine, delete I)
            R.x-y.v I.i.u | i not in x-y			leave alone, nonoverlapping
            I.i.u = insert u before op @ index i
            R.x-y.u = replace x-y indexed tokens with u
            First we need to examine replaces.  For any replace op:
            		1. wipe out any insertions before op within that range.
            		2. Drop any replace op before that is contained completely within
            that range.
            		3. Throw exception upon boundary overlap with any previous replace.
            Then we can deal with inserts:
            		1. for any inserts to same index, combine even if not adjacent.
            		2. for any prior replace with same left boundary, combine this
            insert with replace and delete this replace.
            		3. throw exception if index in same range as previous replace
            Don't actually delete; make op null in list. Easier to walk list.
            Later we can throw as we add to index -&gt; op map.
            Note that I.2 R.2-2 will wipe out I.2 even though, technically, the
            inserted stuff would be before the replace range.  But, if you
            add tokens in front of a method body '{' and then delete the method
            body, I think the stuff before the '{' you added should disappear too.
